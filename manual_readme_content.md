#### To Generate API Credentials

- Go to Accounts >> API Credentials
- Click New API Credential to generate an API key for your application. You can enter the name of
  the application for reference purposes and assign a scope of read only or read and write
  permissions as per your requirements.
- Store this generated API key somewhere secure since it cannot be retrieved after closing the
  window.

#### Base URL

- There are 3 different Base URLs available:

  - api.amp.cisco.com
  - api.apjc.amp.cisco.com

- To find the Base URL, Go to Accounts >> API Credentials

  value of the **api_host** parameter in the URL.

- If Base URL is not provided, **https://api.amp.sourcefire.com/** will be used as the Base URL by
  default.
